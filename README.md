# offlinesequencer
This will visualize OnlineSequencer files in a sequencer, that can then be played (coming soon)
**Automatically downloads needed libraries**
How To Use:
• Extract zip file of source code.
• Run "gui_main.py"
• Should open the sequencer, you can use 'file>import' to import .sequence files.
AWFUL CODE PLEASE IGNORE I'M GOING TO REWRITE THIS ALL IN C++ OR SOMETHING
