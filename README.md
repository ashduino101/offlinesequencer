# onlinesequencer-to-txt
This will convert new OnlineSequencer sequences to a plain text file. Coming Soon (in a day or 2): re-converting text to .sequence files

How To Use:
• Extract zip file of source code.
• Put sequence files in folder with scripts.
• Run "convert.py" (requires termcolor, install with "pip install termcolor" in command prompt).
• Text files should output to the folder.
